## Hello, I'm Darek Kay! 👋

I'm a front-end developer and an [accessibility advocate](https://darekkay.com/tags/accessibility/). I love sharing what I know through [my blog](https://darekkay.com/), teaching and [speaking at conferences](https://github.com/darekkay/presentations). If you want to learn more about what I do, look at all the [awesome things](https://darekkay.com/projects/) I'm building to make people's lives better. 💖

In my free time, I enjoy [photography](https://photos.darekkay.com/), board games, movies and playing instruments.
